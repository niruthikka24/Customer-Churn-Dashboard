create a virtual environment: - <br />
In the vscode terminal, give the following commands: - <br />
  py -3 -m pip install virtualenv <br />
  py -3 -m venv venv <br />
  venv\Scripts\activate <br />
Then install the following dependencies (using pip install or pip3 install): -  <br />
  pandas <br />
